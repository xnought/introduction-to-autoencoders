This article is a gentle introduction to get the idea of what an autoencoder is doing. Within this website, you can train an *actual* autoencoder and see how three dimensional data is encoded into two dimensions and reconstructed back to three dimensions. The rest of the article goes slightly deeper and breaks down each component. 

This interactive article was accepted at the IEEE VIS | [VISxAI Workshop](https://visxai.io/). You can see the [pitch presenation on youtube](https://youtu.be/1WRnmHIy09M).
